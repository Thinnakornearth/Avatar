# Avatar Government Project

This project is a government service simulation where the web platform allows every citizen of Avatar to use the provided services.
There are now three services in this platform which are:

*Travel Exemption Service.
*Driver Licence Service.
*Birth Certificate Service.

# Project Approach

The project uses microservices approach to develop the services. This means all services are independent so this method eliminates all problems in monolithic architecture. 
The API gateway allows us to map all of the incoming calls and direct them to appropraite destinations.
